## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

![Del1](/Resources/del_one.png)

* Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mgp values in the data set?
	* The variables that provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values are the vehicle length and ground clearance.
* Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
	* No, the slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero. The p-value is 5.35e-11, which is lower than our assumed significance level of 0.05%, so our slope is not zero.
* Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively?  Why or why not? 
	* This linear model predicts the mpg of MechaCar prototypes somewhat significantly.  The r-squared is 0.71.
